# API Guidelines

## Description
Guidelines for the API design and development at Banco BPI.

## Goal
The purpose of this repository is to provide a live style guide that helps teams in API modeling, with validations that can be performed during modeling and during the API lifecycle.

## Use it
Create a `.spectral.yml` and extend `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bancobpi/style-guide/main/spectral-bpi.yml`

```yaml
extends:
  - 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bancobpi/style-guide/main/spectral-bpi.yml'
```

## Rules Specification

The spectral is divided into six parts. Two are transversal related to OpenAPI standard rules and four are specific to BPI's internal government rules. For these four we present the reason for each rule and an illustrative image that supports the validation resolution.
